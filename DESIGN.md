# Vault Dash — Design Document

**Status**: Active Development (Week 1-2)  
**Platform**: Android (Unity 2022 LTS)  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-20  

---

## 🎮 Core Vision

**Game**: Clash Royale/Subway Surfers-inspired **isometric runner** with **1v1 real-time multiplayer**

**USP**: 
- Casual arcade vibe (isometric top-down camera)
- Competitive 1v1 with opponent skin showcase
- Freemium monetization (cosmetics only)
- Smooth, responsive controls

---

## 📐 Camera & Perspective

### Main Game Camera
- **View**: Isometric top-down (45° angle, NOT close side-view)
- **Effect**: Arcade casual vibe (Clash Royale feel, NOT Subway Surfers claustrophobia)
- **Space**: Maximizes screen real estate for 1v1 UI + effects

### Player Position
- Center of screen
- 3 lanes visible horizontally
- Obstacles approaching from top

### Distance Formula
```
distance = opponent_y - player_y (in-game units)
Shown in top bar as real-time countdown
```

---

## 🏃 Player Mechanics

### Movement
- **Lanes**: 3 lanes (left, center, right)
- **Input**: Swipe left/right to switch lanes
- **Animation**: Programmatic leg cycle per character profile
- **Speed**: Base 5 units/sec (adjustable per arena)

### Actions
- **Jump**: Swipe up → parabolic arc (0.6s flight time)
- **Crouch**: Swipe down → flatten for 0.8s
- **Active Skill**: Double-tap character icon → unique ability per character

### Collision
- Obstacles: Instant fail (except power-up protected)
- Loot: Auto-collect (coins, gems, XP)
- Power-ups: Collect to activate

---

## 🎯 1v1 Multiplayer Flow

### Match Start
```
Matchmaking → Both players load tunnel
Ready? → Simultaneous start
Nakama sync (Tencent/global servers)
```

### During Run
**Top Bar** (always visible):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👤 YOU (Lvl 12)        vs        👤 OPPONENT (Lvl 8)   │
│ Agent Zero [████████░░]    Jake [███░░░░░░░░░░]        │
│ Dist: 500m [████░░░░░░]    Active: Magnet [5s]         │
│ HP: 100% [████████░░]      HP: 80% [████░░░░░░]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Distance Mechanics**:
- 500m: Opponent visible in top bar only (progress bars)
- 250m: Opponent character skin shown (who they are)
- 100m: **Opponent APPEARS in your tunnel!** (side lane)
- 0m: **COLLISION** → Winner determined
- Post-match: Victory skin animation showcase

### Power-Up Interaction
- Your power-up activates: Enemy sees effect in top bar
- Enemy power-up activates: You see it incoming in top bar
- **Visual**: Incoming skill icons + cooldown timers

### End Game
```
Last hit / First finish → Victory screen
Winner's skin animation (2-3 sec)
Rewards: Trophies, coins, XP
Back to menu
```

## 📝 Notes for Implementation

### Key Decisions
1. **Isometric NOT side-view** → Casual arcade vibe
2. **Top bar first, opponent in tunnel later** → Faster iteration
3. **Parallax 3 layers** → Modern feel vs Subway Surfers
4. **Skin showcase = monetization driver** → Cosmetics only P2W

### Potential Blockers
- Isometric camera math (perspective scaling)
- Nakama matchmaking (cloud config)
- Top bar UI layout (many elements)

### Optimization Points
- Draw call batching (obstacles + loot)
- Physics optimization (2D vs programmatic collision)
- Asset loading (PNG streaming)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **NOW**: Discuss + finalize design
2. **Week 1**: Implement core (camera, movement, tunnel)
3. **Week 2**: Integrate 1v1 top bar + Nakama
4. **Saturday**: Test! Iterate on feedback
5. **Week 3**: Opponent in tunnel + visuals
6. **Week 4+**: Polish + monetization

- Trade Speed Boost for ally power-up (clan mode)
- Risk/reward: "Do I use Shield or force their mistake?"

**Example Flow**:
```
You have: Shield (5s) + Magnet (3s)
You activate: Shield

Turn 3: New power-up spawns
Opponent gets: Freeze
You trade: Sacrifice Shield → Opponent gets Reverse (2s)

Result: You're vulnerable, but opponent loses control for 2s
```

**Advanced**:
